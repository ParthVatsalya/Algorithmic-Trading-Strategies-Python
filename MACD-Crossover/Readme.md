# **Introduction**

The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator which uses the difference between two exponential moving averages to determine the momentum and the direction of the market. The MACD crossover occurs when the MACD line and the signal line intercept, often indicating a change in the momentum/trend of the market. The MACD is seen as an effective indicator, especially in trending markets.



# **Components of the MACD:**

• **The MACD line:** The MACD line (blue line) is the difference between the two exponential moving averages (usually the last 12 and 26 days or weeks) and is usually referred to as the faster line.

• **Signal line:** The signal line is usually a 9 period exponentially smoothed average of the MACD line and will be referred to as the slower line.

• **Zero line:** The MACD lines fluctuate above and below a zero line, giving the MACD the qualities of an oscillator.

• **Histogram:** The histogram consists of vertical lines that show the spread between the two MACD lines.
